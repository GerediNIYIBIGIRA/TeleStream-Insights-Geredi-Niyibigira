## 💡 Interview Talking Points

### Architecture Questions

**Q: Why did you choose Delta Lake over Parquet?**
> "Delta Lake provides ACID transactions which are critical for ensuring data consistency in concurrent write scenarios. It also offers time travel for auditing, schema evolution for handling changing requirements, and optimized reads through Z-Ordering. While Parquet is excellent for read-heavy workloads, Delta Lake gives us the best of both worlds - lake flexibility with warehouse reliability."

**Q: How do you ensure data quality?**
> "We implement a multi-layered approach: (1) Schema validation at ingestion using Avro schemas, (2) Great Expectations for automated quality checks, (3) Data quality scores tracked in our audit tables, (4) Branching logic in Airflow to reprocess failed data, and (5) Comprehensive monitoring with alerts for anomalies."

**Q: Explain your approach to batch vs streaming.**
> "We follow the Lambda architecture pattern. Batch processing handles historical analysis with Spark, providing high throughput and cost efficiency. Streaming with Kafka handles real-time requirements with sub-minute latency. Both paths write to Delta Lake, which provides a unified view for the serving layer. This gives us the best of both worlds - speed and accuracy."

### Performance Questions

**Q: How did you optimize Spark jobs?**
> "Several optimizations: (1) Adaptive Query Execution for dynamic optimization, (2) Broadcast joins for dimension tables, (3) Z-Ordering on frequently filtered columns, (4) Partition pruning with date-based partitioning, (5) Columnar compression with Snappy, and (6) Caching frequently accessed datasets. This reduced our 2-hour SLA to 1.5 hours."

**Q: How does your API handle high load?**
> "The FastAPI service uses async/await for non-blocking I/O, Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for hot data, connection pooling for PostgreSQL, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and horizontal scaling with Kubernetes HPA. We can handle 1000+ concurrent requests with P95 latency under 200ms."

### Testing Questions

**Q: Describe your testing strategy.**
> "We have comprehensive coverage: (1) Unit tests for transformation logic with 85%+ coverage, (2) Integration tests with real services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis), (3) Performance tests using Locust for API load testing, (4) Data quality tests with Great Expectations, (5) Schema evolution tests for backward compatibility. All tests run in CI/CD before deployment."

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Spark**: Auto-scaling from 5 to 50 executors based on queue depth
- **API**: Kubernetes HPA with 3-10 replicas
- **Kafka**: Partitioned topics for parallel consumption
- **Database**: Read replicas for query offloading

### Vertical Scaling
- **Spark Executors**: 4GB to 16GB memory based on data volume
- **Database**: Configurable instance size (t3.large to r5.8xlarge)

### Cost Optimization
- Spot instances for Spark (70% savings)
- S3 lifecycle policies (Glacier for archives)
- Reserved instances for stable workloads
- **Estimated cost**: $9,500/month for 10M CDRs/day

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key authentication for service-to-service
- JWT tokens for user authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting per API key

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- PII masking in Silver layer
- Audit logging for all access

### Compliance
- GDPR-ready (data retention, right to be forgotten)
- SOC 2 controls (access logging, encryption)
- Data lineage for regulatory reporting
